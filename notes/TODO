Project:

 Scripts to be developped:
   ☐ exploration scripts: processing_bson_files,category_names_and_levels @started 
   ☐ data loading script (caching or sampling?, speed)
   ☐ pic processing script
   ☐ label processing script
   ☐ basic model script
   ☐ result output script
   ☐ performance tracking script

  Architecture Dependencies:
   ☐ data loading pre-processing function will be used in the TF data pipeline / study how the TF pipeline should be set up @ started

   Quality:
     ☐ functions will be documented using http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html

Code:

  Basic Model:
    ☐ directly match a pretrained model's last layer to the 5000 categories
    ☐ does not have to train on the entire training data set
    ☐ more advanced model may use the product category levels (see notebooks/category_names_and_levels) with one "simple" model to discriminate at each level except for the first the model who would have the most conv layer
