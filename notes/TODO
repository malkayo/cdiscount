Project:

 Scripts to be developped:
   ☐ exploration scripts: processing_bson_files,category_names_and_levels @complete
   ☐ how many pictures per product? => 1 to 4 with  more than 80% with only 1 picture
   ☐ label processing script
   ☐ validation error investigation notebook
   ☐ data indexing script [index.py] @complete
   ☐ pic processing script [generator.py] @complete
   ☐ basic model script [training.py] @complete
   ☐ result output script [predict.py] @complete
   ☐ performance tracking script [tensorflow callback in training.py] @complete

  Architecture Dependencies:
   ☐ data loading pre-processing function will be used in the TF data pipeline / study how the TF pipeline should be set up @complete

   Quality:
     ☐ functions will be documented using http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html

Code:

  Basic Model:
    ☐ directly match a pretrained model's last layer to the 5000 categories [InceptionV3]
    ☐ does not have to train on the entire training data set [20%]
    ☐ more advanced model may use the product category levels (see notebooks/category_names_and_levels) with one "simple" model to discriminate at each level except for the first the model who would have the most conv layer

  Queuing Module:
    ☐ Create a list of filenames (categories?) and locations which hold the data
    ☐ Create a FIFOQueu to hold randomly shuffled filenames and associated enqueuing
    ☐ Dequeue files and extract image data
    ☐ Perform image processing
    ☐ Enqueue processed image data into a RandomShuffleQueue
    ☐ Dequeue data batches for classifier training
    ☐ NOT USED: for complexity reasons ; used keras generator instead

  Predict.py:
    ☐ Install h5py (see save_model() call in training.py) @complete
